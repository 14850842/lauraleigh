						<h1>FAQ's</h1>
						<hr>
						<h2>Weddings</h2>
						<p>What is your style of photography?</p>
						<p>I would say that my style of photography is a mixture of creative portraiture and documentary. I set aside time before the ceremony to take gorgeous portraits of you and then again during the couple shoot after the ceremony. In between this, for example when you are getting ready, during the ceremony and the reception I take documentary  / photo journalistic pictures where I capture the spontaneous moments. These images will show all the emotion that happens on a wedding day.</p><hr>
						<p>How far in advance should we book your services for our wedding?</p>
						<p>Max 1 year in advance</p><hr>
						<p>How do I know how many hours of photography I need at my wedding?</p>
						<p>I like to arrive at the venue approx. 3 hour before we have to leave for the ceremony.  I need this time to photograph the reception, the venue, your pretty details, document the getting ready part of the day and then do your portraits. After the ceremony I spend approx. 1 – 1.5 hours for  the entire “photo shoot” part of the day – the family shoot, bridal party shoot and your couple shoot. You can then calculate how long you would like me to stay at the reception.</p><hr>
						<p>When is the best time to do the couple shoot on the wedding day?</p>
						<p>1 hour before sunset. I will be able to work it out for you and suggest what time we start the shoot.</p><hr>
						<p>Is there anything I can do to help me get great pictures at my wedding?</p>
						<p>There are lots of things you can do to ensure you get great pics on your date! </p>
						<p><strong>Getting Ready Photos</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>The getting ready pictures are one of my favorite things to photograph! To make sure you look your best make sure the preparation venue has lots of natural light! Spend a few extra bucks on a 5 star boutique hotel or guesthouse. It will be worth every cent. I cannot stress this fact enough!</li>
								<li>Make sure you keep the room clean. Designate a separate room or closet to store all the bags and clothing you are not using. A bright florescent pink suitcase never looks great in shots.</li>
								<li>Have all your pretty details including your dress you would like photographed available.
								</li>
								<li>Be ready 1 hour before the ceremony to do some solo shots of yourself and bridesmaid shots etc…
								</li>
							</ul>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Ceremony</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>If you ceremony is taking place outside make sure that you stand under a shaded area so that you don’t get horrible shadows on your face.</li>
								<li>Stand close together.</li>
							</ul>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Family Shots</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>This should only take +/- 20 minutes if planned correctly. If not if can eat into your couple shoot time.</li>
								<li>Send me a list of the different groups shots you want BEFORE YOUR WEDDING DAY.  Make sure that everyone on that list knows that they will be in the group shots directly after the ceremony, so that we don’t waste time tracking them down. Designate the maid of honor or the MC to call out the names on the list after each shot.</li>
								<li>Having layers in the shot makes it a lot more interesting that just standing in a straight line. Organize a couch or chairs in the area where group shots will be taken.</li>
							</ul>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Couple Shots</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Don’t allow friends or family members to tag along with their cameras. This can be very distracting. Only allow 1 bridesmaid to come and help out with makeup touches and fluffing for the dress etc…</li>
								<li>Depending on the venue you might want to bring an extra pair of shoes. </li>
								<li>Don’t worry about getting your dress dirty. By the end of the night it will probably be a bit dirty anyway.</li>
								<li>Relax and enjoy yourselves. I love the more natural looking shots and it is hard to achieve this look if you are stiff and nervous. Just be yourselves and your personality will shine through.</li>
							</ul>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Reception</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Again, make sure there is enough light! Candles are not enough. The more light at the reception the better the pictures will come out.</li>
								<li>When possible make sure the reception is finished at least 30 minutes before I start with the bridal preparation shots.</li>
							</ul>
						<hr>
						<p>Do you do table shots and go around taking pictures of every guest during the reception?</p>
						<p>I prefer not to do table shots for many reasons too long to list. I much prefer capturing candid shots of the guests laughing, drinking, and enjoying themselves than horrible stiff pictures gathered around a messy table with empty plates etc... If you would like to hear my reasons for not doing table shots you can give me a ring.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>Which suppliers do you love working with?</p>
						<p>These are the suppliers I have a very close relationship with and LOVE them to bits!</p>
						<ul>
								<li>Stationary - Bianca from Pistachio Designs</li>
								<li>Makeup - Michelle from make-up by Michelle</li>
								<li>Videography - Andreas from Hauke and Lourens from Mighty Fine </li>
								<li>Décor and planning - Eve from Splendid Affairs </li>
							</ul>
						<hr>
						<p>Do you edit all the pictures?
						</p>
						<p>Yes, I edit all the images you received one by one and don’t do batching in bulk groups. I have an editing team who assists me with the editing process.</p><hr>
						<p>How many pictures will we receive?</p>
						<p>The number of photographs taken depends on many things – the number of guests, the hours of coverage etc… My average number is 700 images.</p><hr>
						<p>Can we get the RAW files?</p>
						<p>The RAW / unedited files aren’t available for viewing or purchase.  The images delivered to you are all the technically correct images, taking out only eyes closed,  person walking in front of camera etc… Please note that when editing I am not striving to hit a specific number of images to deliver and throwing out “good” pictures.</p><hr>
						<p>How long after the wedding will it take to get out pictures?</p>
						<p>In the contract it states 3-4 weeks, however I usually get the pics to my clients within 2 weeks.</p><hr>
						<p>How does the album design process work?</p>
						<p>You have 1 year to make your album selections before there is a fee due to yearly production costs. You get to preview your album design and make 1 round of changes before a change fee is assessed. Once the album is approved you choose your album cover and it will go to print. Once you have chosen your images for your album it takes approx. 1 week to design.</p><hr>
						<p>How long does it take to get the albums?
								</p>
						<p>Once you have approved the layout and design it takes approx. 2-3 weeks to get back from print.</p><hr>
						<p>What will my album look like?</p>
						<p>Please see the products section on my website to get a better idea of what the album will look like. I like to keep the album layout very clean and simple. You have the choice of 3 different linen covers for your album which are wheat, grey and aqua.
						</p><hr>
						<p>How do I secure you as our photographer for our wedding?</p>
						<p>You can pop me an email to see if I am available on your date. If I am, I require a R 4000 deposit and the date is yours.</p><hr>
						<p>What equipment do you use?</p>
						<p>I have 2 Nikon D4’s, my lens choices are Nikkor 85mm f/1.4, Nikkor 35mm f/1.4 Nikkor 50mm f/1.4, Nikkor 105mm f/1.4, Nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8, Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8. I have 2 Nikon SB910 flashes, portable studio lighting. Then in the office I have two beautiful 27” iMacs. </p><hr>

						<p><strong>Couple Shoot / Engagement Shoot FAQ </strong>
						</p>
						<p>We have no idea what to do for our couple shoot – any suggestions?</p>
						<p>I prefer shooting in natural light, so definitely starting the shoot 1 hour before sunset is advisable
						Think of what you like, maybe where you met, what is sentimental to you etc… and then we can go from there. I also offer the option of doing a styled shoot. If you would like more info on styled shoots pop me an email. 
						I can email you a mood board for inspirations on what to wear as this really makes or breaks the shoot in my opinion. </p><hr>
						<p>When can we do our couple shoot?</p>
						<p>I am only able to do your couple shoot on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday due to my wedding schedule. I occasionally have a Friday available though.</p><hr>
						<p>How many images will I get?</p>
						<p>You will receive approx. 100 images
						</p>
						<hr>
						<p>Is it necessary to have a makeup artist?
						</p>
						<p>Yes, I strongly recommend you use a makeup artist! I have an amazing makeup artist I work very closely with. Her name is Michelle and her email address is info@make-upbymichelle.co.za
						</p><hr>
						<p><strong>Boudoir Shoot FAQ</strong></p>
						<p>What is a boudoir shoot and should I do one?</p>
						<p>Boudoir comes from late 18th century French word and is translated as – a woman’s bedroom or a private sitting room. Boudoir photography, therefore, usually takes place in a setting such as a bedroom or a hotel room - an intimate setting to create classy, tasteful images that can be soft, romantic, sexy and beautiful. The main focus of a boudoir photographer is to capture you in the most flattering way. </p>
						<hr>
						<p>Who should do boudoir photography?</p>
						<ul>
								<li>A woman that wants to surprise that special one in her life with a unique and personal gift. There’s something about seeing him open that photo album for the first time and drool all over your sexy photos</li>
								<li>A woman who needs a confidence boost. O yes, we all occasionally get really tired of looking at these glossy magazines with “perfect” models on every page. Well, now it can be you looking back from a sexy picture.</li>
								<li>A woman that is already confident and just wants to strut her sexy stuff in front of the camera and have some fun! Why not just make it all about you and give yourself a gift?</li>
								<li>A woman that wants to capture her beauty forever. Lets face it, none of us are getting younger.  30 years from now your Boudoir photo album will be one of your most cherished possessions ;)</li>
								<p>We provide a makeup artist to ensure you look your absolute best!</p>
							</ul>
						<hr>
						<p>Where does the boudoir shoot take place?</p>
						<p>I have transformed a room in my house for boudoir shoots. It has the most beautiful light in the afternoon.</p> 
						<hr>
						<p>How many images will I get?</p>
						<p>You will receive approx. 70 images.</p>
