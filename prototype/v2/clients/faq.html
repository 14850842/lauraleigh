						<h1>FAQ's</h1>
						<hr>
						What is your style of photography?
						<p>I would say that my style of photography is a mixture of creative portraiture and documentary. I set aside time before the ceremony to take gorgeous portraits of you and then again during the couple shoot after the ceremony. In between this, for example when you are getting ready, during the ceremony and the reception I take documentary  / photo journalistic pictures where I capture the spontaneous moments. These images will show all the emotion that happens on a wedding day.</p><hr>
						How do I know how many hours of photography I need at my wedding?
						<p>I like to arrive at the venue approx. 3 hour before we have to leave for the ceremony.  I need this time to photograph the reception, the venue, your pretty details, document the getting ready part of the day and then do your portraits. After the ceremony I spend approx. 1 – 1.5 hours for all the pics – the family shoot, bridal party shoot and your couple shoot. You can then calculate how long you would like me to stay at the reception.</p><hr>
						When is the best time to do the couple shoot at the wedding?
						<p>1 hour before sunset. I will be able to work it out for you and suggest what time we start the shoot.</p><hr>
						Is there anything I can do to help me get great pictures at my wedding?
						<p>There are lots of things you can do to ensure you get great pics on your date! </p>
						<br>
						<p>Getting Ready Photos</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The getting ready pictures are one of my favorite things to photograph! To make sure you look your best make sure the preparation venue has lots of natural light! Spend a few extra bucks on a 5 star boutique hotel or guesthouse. It will be worth every cent. I cannot stress this fact enough!</li>
								<li>Make sure you keep the room clean. Designate a separate room or closet to store all the bags and clothing you are not using. A bright florescent pink suitcase never looks great in shots. </li>
								<li>Have all your pretty details including your dress you would like photographed available.
								</li>
								<li>Be ready 1 hour before the ceremony to do some solo shots of yourself and bridesmaid shots etc…
								</li>
							</ul>
						<br>
						<p>Ceremony</p>
							<ul>
								<li>If you ceremony is taking place outside make sure that you stand under a shaded area so that you don’t get horrible shadows on your face.</li>
								<li>Stand close together!</li>
							</ul>
						<br>
						<p>Family Shots</p>
							<ul>
								<li>This should only take +/- 20 minutes if planned correctly. If not if can eat into your couple shoot time.</li>
								<li>Send me a list of the different groups shots you want BEFORE YOUR WEDDING DAY.  Make sure that everyone on that list knows that they will be in the group shots directly after the ceremony, so that we don’t waste time tracking them down. Designate the maid of honor or the MC to call out the names on the list after each shot.</li>
								<li>Having layers in the shot makes it a lot more interesting that just standing in a straight line. Organize a couch or chairs in the area where group shots will be taken.</li>
							</ul>
						<br>
						<p>Couple Shots</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Don’t allow friends or family members to tag along with their cameras. This can be very distracting. Only allow 1 bridesmaid to come and help out with makeup touches and fluffing for the dress etc…</li>
								<li>Depending on the venue you might want to bring an extra pair of shoes.</li>
								<li>Don’t worry about getting your dress dirty. By the end of the night it will probably be a bit dirty anyway.</li>
								<li>Relax and enjoy yourselves. I love the more natural looking shots and it is hard to achieve this look if you are stiff and nervous. Just be yourselves and your personality will shine through.</li>
							</ul>
						<br>
						<p>Reception</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Again, make sure there is enough light! Candles are not enough. The more light at the reception the better the pictures will come out.</li>
								<li>When possible make sure the reception is finished at least 30 minutes before I start with the bridal preparation shots.</li>
							</ul>
						<hr>
						We have no idea what to do for our couple shoot – any suggestions?
						<p>I prefer shooting in natural light, so definitely starting the shoot 1 hour before sunset is a advisable. I love pretty, romantic, pastel, soft ,colours. So whenever my client arrives is gorgeous, long flowy dress I get very excited! I also suggest bringing a bouquet of flowers to this type of shoot as it just adds something special and gives the hands something to do. This is my preference, but at the end of the day the shoot is about you. So think of what you like, maybe where you met, what is sentimental to you etc… and then we can go from there. I also offer the option of doing a styled shoot. If you would like more info on styled shoots just ask.</p>
						<hr>
						How far in advance should we book your services for our wedding?
						<p>Max 1 year in advance</p>
						<hr>
						Which suppliers do you love working with?
						<p>These are the suppliers I have a very close relationship with and LOVE them to bits!</p>
						<ul>
								<li>Stationary - Bianca from Pistachio Designs</li>
								<li>Makeup - Michelle from make-up by Michelle</li>
								<li>Makeup - Michelle from make-up by Michelle</li>

						What equipment do you use?
						<p><a href="#">View my gear here</a></p>
						<hr>
						What is a boudoir shoot and should I do one?
						<p>Boudoir comes from late 18th century French word and is translated as – a woman’s bedroom or a private sitting room. Boudoir photography, therefore, usually takes place in a setting such as a bedroom or a hotel room - an intimate setting to create classy, tasteful images that can be soft, romantic, sexy and beautiful. The main focus of a boudoir photographer is to capture you in the most flattering way. </p>
						<hr>
						Who should do boudoir photography?
						<ul>
								<li>A woman that wants to surprise that special one in her life with a unique and personal gift. There’s something about seeing him open that photo album for the first time and drool all over your sexy photos</li>
								<li>A woman who needs a confidence boost. O yes, we all occasionally get really tired of looking at these glossy magazines with “perfect” models on every page. Well, now it can be you looking back from a sexy picture.</li>
								<li>A woman that is already confident and just wants to strut her sexy stuff in front of the camera and have some fun! Why not just make it all about you and give yourself a gift?</li>
								<li>A woman that wants to capture her beauty forever. Lets face it, none of us are getting younger.  30 years from now your Boudoir photo album will be one of your most cherished possessions ;)</li>
								<p>We provide a makeup artist to ensure you look your absolute best!</p>
