			"content": "I would say that my style of photography is a mixture of creative portraiture and documentary. I set aside time before the ceremony to take gorgeous portraits of you and then again during the couple shoot after the ceremony. In between this, for example when you are getting ready, during the ceremony and the reception I take documentary  / photo journalistic pictures where I capture the spontaneous moments. These images will show all the emotion that happens on a wedding day."

			"content": "I like to arrive at the venue approx. 3 hour before we have to leave for the ceremony.  I need this time to photograph the reception, the venue, your pretty details, document the getting ready part of the day and then do your portraits. After the ceremony I spend approx. 1 – 1.5 hours for all the pics – the family shoot, bridal party shoot and your couple shoot. You can then calculate how long you would like me to stay at the reception."
